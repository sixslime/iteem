 ...
--------------------
 - this hook allows changing/observation of ALL items that the player can interact with.
 - xtem will call this hook immediately on any item that is not registered, and then register it (keeping any modifications made to it via this hook).

 - [item] is an item display entity that holds the registering item in its `item` nbt path.
  ~ (note that this can also be accessed via [item]'s `container.0` slot.)
 - any modifications to the item in [item]'s `container.0` slot or `item` nbt path will be put onto the newly registered item.
